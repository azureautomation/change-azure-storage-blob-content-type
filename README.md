Change Azure Storage Blob Content Type
======================================

            

In case you're utilizing applications, you would like for each file in your storage account container to have the proper content type.


Very powerfull Powershell function meant to change the content type of all files inside the Storage Account Container. Function is pretty generic so it can be used to iterrate over any number of storage accounts and containers. Probably not all possibilities
 are container in the function in regards to the content type, please post a comment and I will update it. 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
